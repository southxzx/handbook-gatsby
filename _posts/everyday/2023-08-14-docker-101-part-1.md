## 1. Overview

> **Docker** is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. It provides a consistent environment for applications to run, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

**Docker container** is quite similar to VM in term of they has it's own process, root file.

But since **VM** is the isolated OS itself, otherwise **Docker containers** share the same OS. VM tends to be more secure compared with Docker container but much more slower.

## 2. Docker concepts/components

### Image

Docker images are the building blocks of containers, contain everything to run application (code, libraries, system tools,...).

Images is created from **Dockerfile**.

```js
docker build -t {image-name}:{tag} // create from dockerfile

docker image ls // see the list of images

docker run {image-name}:{tag} // run the container from the specified image

docker image rm {name/id} -f // remove image, -f is force
```

### Container

Containers are instances of Docker images -> running and executing in an isolated environment.

```js
// run the container from the specified image + mapping port
docker run --name {name} {image-name} -p 3000:3000

docker start {name/id} // run existed container

docker stop {name/id} // stop container

docker ps -a // list containers

docker container rm {name/id} // remove container
```

### Dockerfile

Within the **Dockerfile**, use various instructions to define the image's configuration:

```
FROM: parent image
RUN: execute command -> install dependencies
WORKDIR: working directory -> easier to manage and organize
COPY/ADD: copy local files to the image
EXPOSE: which port container should listen in run time
CMD/ENTRYPOINT: command to run when container starts
```

Example:

```
FROM node:16-alpine
EXPOSE 6060
WORKDIR /app
COPY ["package.json", ".babelrc", "tsconfig.json", "nodemon.json", "yarn.lock", ".env", "./"]
RUN yarn
RUN yarn add ts-node-dev --save
COPY . .
CMD [ "yarn", "dev" ]
```

### Volume

Volumes in Docker can be used to mount data from a container to the host machine or vice versa.

```
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container {image-name}

// -v flag is used to specify the volume mount
```

Any changes in the container -> persisted on the host machine -> access and manage the data from outside the container.

### Others

In case of running out disk space, we can use:

`docker system prune`

to clean up unused data in Docker environment (containers, volumes, images,...)
