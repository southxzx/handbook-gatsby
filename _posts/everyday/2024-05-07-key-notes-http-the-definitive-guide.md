The key notes from the book **HTTP The Definitive Guide**

## 1. HTTP: The Web's Foundation

**HTTP** is a protocol that is popular with web applications. It helps to transfer billion of JPEG images, HTML pages, text files, audio,... everyday.

Each **web resource** has a name, and URI/URL is the unique address to point to that resource.

**HTTP transaction** consists of requests from the client and responses from the server. This communication happens with a formatted-block of data called **HTTP messages**.

**HTTP messages** will contain: Method, Request URL, Status Code, Header, Entity Body,...

HTTP is carried over **TCP/IP connection**.

- TCP connection: carries HTTP data in order (without corruption)
- IP -> point to the right computer
- PORT -> point to the right application

## 2. HTTP Architecture

A **web server** processes HTTP requests and save responses. The term **"web server"** can refer either to web server software or to the particular device or computer dedicated to serve the website. One common example is **Apache**.

**Web robots** are software programs that automate a series of web transactions with-out human interaction.
- Other names: crawler, spider.
- robots.txt: instruct robot how to crawl a website, what to include and exclude. Bot should retrieve robots.txt when they first visit the site.
- Robot also adhere to document meta tags such as: noindex, nofollow,...
- Canonical: a canonical URL will help robot to eliminate the aliasing problem of a website that different URLs alias to the same document.

The other elements of HTTP Architecture are: **Proxy, Caching**.

## 3. Identification, Authentication & Security.

There are some approaches to help to identify a user on the website by using: HTTP Header, check client's IP address, user login, fat URL, Cookies (best).

Authentication:
- Basic authentication: use username + password on the authorization header. Maybe encoded as base64.
- Digest authentication: instead of sending username and password. This will sent a fingerprint that generated by functions such as MD5.

Secure HTTP:
- HTTPS: all HTTP requests/responses is encrypted before being sent. HTTPS works by providing a secured layer (SSL).
- **SSL certificates** are used to authenticate servers and establish a secure connection between the client and the server. The certificate includes: hostname, public key, signing authority, signature...

## 4. Entities, Encodings, and Internationalization

This chapter describes the formats and syntax of  HTTP content. 

> "Messages Are Crates, Entities Are Cargo"

The URL should only contain US-ASCII character set. With those characters that are not safe. We have an encoding mechanism by using an "escape" notation (% + 2 hexadecimal that represent the ASCII code of the characters).

## 5. Content Publishing and Distribution

Part V talks all about the technology for publishing and disseminating web content.

The hosting service use a one big physical server and to share with others if one client doesn't really need a whole physical server.

The problem with one server is that it might break due to some specific reasons. And here's the mirrored server farms come to cover each others. 

**CDN** (content distribution network) is simply a network whose purpose is the distribution of specific content. the nodes of network can be web servers, surrogates, proxy caches. Example: **Cloudfare**, **AWS Cloudfront**,...
